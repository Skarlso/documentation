# Gardener Review Meetings (2022)

In case you couldn't participate and are interested in catching up, you can find the contents of the review meetings we have had in 2022 here.

Note that all review meetings in 2022 were SAP-internal meetings back then. Despite those, we also had a few [Community Meetings](./2022-community.md) in the public.

#### No Demo, But Still Worth Celebrating 🎉

- 📈 [OPERATOR] CPU limits from all gardener components have been removed to prevent CPU throttling due to reaching limits. [#5627](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/5627)
- 📈 [OPERATOR] Memory limits of all shoot control plane or system components have been removed or adjusted according to measured usage to prevent OOMKills due to reaching the limits. [#5689](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/5689)
- 📈 [OPERATOR] VPA resources now use `controlledValues: RequestsOnly` to prevent the VPA mechanism from proportionally changing the limits, which doesn't make sense. [#5638](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/5638)
- 🛡 [OPERATOR] `dependency-watchdog-probe` does no longer use a client certificate but an auto-rotated `ServiceAccount` token which is only valid for `12h`. [#5685](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/5685)

- ✨ [USER] There is a new Secret for each Shoot in the corresponding Project Namespace (`<shoot-name>.ca-cluster`) which contains the current CA bundle for establishing trust to the Shoot's API server. [#5612](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/5612)
- 🐛 [OPERATOR] An issue causing Shoot deletion to fail in a rare case when the corresponding Shoot Namespace in the Seed is already terminating is now fixed. [#5555](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/5555)
- 🐛 [USER] A race condition has been fixed which can lead to pods without any projected token volumes for newly created shoots. [#5549](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/5549)
- 🐛 [USER] A bug causing shoot reconciliations or deletions to fail with "no matches for kind" errors has been fixed. [#5539](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/5539)
